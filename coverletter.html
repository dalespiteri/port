      <h1>From the desk of Dale Spiteri</h1>
      <p>Dear <span id="your-name"></span>,</p>
      <p>I recently visited your offices for a networking event with Hackernest, and I had the pleasure of meeting a few people who work for Flipp while I was there. I remember the first thing I thought when I walked in the doors was that I wanted to work here. Everything about the office space, and the people I met, clicked. I asked these people about their experiences working at the company, and they all preached that being the right fit for your workplace was the most important quality you could bring to the table. I feel like I can be that right fit.</p>
      <p>The people I met were all eager to help, and listen, and discuss challenges I have experienced while learning new coding skills. Learning through community seemed to be a fundamental philosophy of the people I met, and that’s something I can be a strong part of. I prefer to learn new skills to do something correctly than to find a way to avoid the problem at hand. I also enjoy being able to share the things I’ve learned through my own experience to help other people improve their skills. I can be a part of the team at Flipp that makes the whole more than the sum of its parts.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your consideration and taking the time to review my application. I sincerely hope to hear from you soon!</p>
